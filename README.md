### Code to reproduce analysis and figures from Mallett et al. ([2021; Comms E&E](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00221-8)).

The code for the final figures (which really synthesise plot-ready arrays) can be found in the respective top level directories. Processing of raw data into more managable formats can be found in /processors/. Key analysis and construction of individual subplots can be found in /key_notebooks/, which have file names corresponding to the subplots. 

A lot of different data sets go into this, see the *Data availability* section of the paper for further information.
